# [257. Binary Tree Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-paths/)

**Level**: `Easy`.

**Topic**: `Tree`, `Binary Tree`, `Depth First Search`, `Backtracking`, `String`.

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _all root-to-leaf paths in **any order**_.

A **leaf** is a node with no children.

**Example 1:**

```txt
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,5]
Output: ["1->2->5","1->3"]
```

**Example 2:**

```txt
Input: root = [1]
Output: ["1"]
 ```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
