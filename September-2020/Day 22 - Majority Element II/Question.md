# [Majority Element II](https://leetcode.com/explore/challenge/card/september-leetcoding-challenge/557/week-4-september-22nd-september-28th/3469/)

Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than `⌊ n/3 ⌋` times.

**Note:** The algorithm should run in linear time and in O(1) space.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [3,2,3]
Output: [3]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,1,1,3,3,2,2,2]
Output: [1,2]
```

**Hint #1**
How many majority elements could it possibly have?
