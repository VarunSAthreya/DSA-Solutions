# [Repeat and Missing Number Array](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/repeat-and-missing-number-array/)

**Level**: `Medium`.

**Topic**: `Array`.

You are given a read only array of n integers from 1 to n.

Each integer appears exactly once except A which appears twice and B which is missing.

Return A and B.

_**Note: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?**_

Note that in your output A should precede B.

**Example:**

```txt
Input:[3 1 2 5 3]

Output:[3, 4]

A = 3, B = 4
```
