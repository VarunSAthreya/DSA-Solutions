# [Count the number of subarrays having a given XOR](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-number-subarrays-given-xor/)

Given an array of integers `arr[]` and a number m, count the number of subarrays having XOR of their elements as m.

**Example 1:**

```
Input : arr[] = {4, 2, 2, 6, 4}, m = 6
Output : 4
Explanation : The subarrays having XOR of
              their elements as 6 are {4, 2},
              {4, 2, 2, 6, 4}, {2, 2, 6},
               and {6}
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input : arr[] = {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, m = 5
Output : 2
Explanation : The subarrays having XOR of
              their elements as 5 are {5}
              and {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
```
